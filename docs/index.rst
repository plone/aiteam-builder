.. note::

   *aiteam-builder* is not a full replacement of `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable>`_ !

   *aiteam-builder* is for creating 'test builds' to get a *visual impression* **not** for more, no spell-check, no link-check and so on.

Limitations
===========

- *aiteam-builder* depends on an *index.rst* file in your root documentation directory
- *aiteam-builder* will report a warning, if there is no *_static* directory in your root documentation directory
